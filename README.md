## Problem1 
Pow(x,n) (https://leetcode.com/problems/powx-n/)

Implement pow(x, n), which calculates x raised to the power n (xn).

Example 1:

Input: 2.00000, 10
Output: 1024.00000
Example 2:

Input: 2.10000, 3
Output: 9.26100
Example 3:

Input: 2.00000, -2
Output: 0.25000
Explanation: 2-2 = 1/22 = 1/4 = 0.25
Note:

-100.0 < x < 100.0
n is a 32-bit signed integer, within the range [−231, 231 − 1]

## Problem2 
Find K Closest Elements (https://leetcode.com/problems/find-k-closest-elements/)


Given a sorted array, two integers k and x, find the k closest elements to x in the array. The result should also be sorted in ascending order. If there is a tie, the smaller elements are always preferred.

Example 1:
Input: [1,2,3,4,5], k=4, x=3
Output: [1,2,3,4]
Example 2:
Input: [1,2,3,4,5], k=4, x=-1
Output: [1,2,3,4]
Note:
The value k is positive and will always be smaller than the length of the sorted array.
Length of the given array is positive and will not exceed 104
Absolute value of elements in the array and x will not exceed 104

## Problem4
Longest Duplicate Substring (https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-duplicate-substring/)

Given a string S, consider all duplicated substrings: (contiguous) substrings of S that occur 2 or more times.  (The occurrences may overlap.)

Return any duplicated substring that has the longest possible length.  (If S does not have a duplicated substring, the answer is "".)

 

Example 1:

Input: "banana"
Output: "ana"
Example 2:

Input: "abcd"
Output: ""
 

Note:

2 <= S.length <= 10^5
S consists of lowercase English letters.
